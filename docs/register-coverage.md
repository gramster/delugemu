# Register coverage

What each emulated device model actually implements, so you know which firmware
behaviour is real and which is faked. Keep this in sync with
[memory-map.md](memory-map.md) and the `RZA1L_*_BASE` defines in
[`src/include/hw/arm/rza1l_soc.h`](../src/include/hw/arm/rza1l_soc.h).

**Coverage legend**

- **modelled** — read and write have real, firmware-visible behaviour.
- **shadow** — value is stored and read back but has no side effects.
- **stub** — returns a fixed/constant value; writes are ignored or only stored.
- **special** — non-trivial behaviour (FIFO window, DMA-routed, IRQ line, etc.).

## MMIO devices

### SCIF — serial / UART · `rza1l-scif`

Base `0xE8007000` (SCIF0, MIDI) and `0xE8007800` (SCIF1, PIC) · size `0x100`.

| Offset | Reg | Coverage | Notes |
| ------ | --- | -------- | ----- |
| 0x00 | SCSMR | shadow | mode |
| 0x04 | SCBRR | shadow | bit rate |
| 0x08 | SCSCR | shadow | control; RIE gates RXI |
| 0x0C | SCFTDR | special | TX byte → chardev (`qemu_chr_fe_write_all`) |
| 0x10 | SCFSR | modelled | TDFE\|TEND always set; RDF/DR on RX |
| 0x14 | SCFRDR | special | RX holding byte; clears rx_full |
| 0x18 | SCFCR | shadow | FIFO control |
| 0x1C | SCFDR | stub | data count, returns 0 or 1 |
| 0x20–0x28 | SCSPTR/SCLSR/SCEMR | stub | |

TX is synchronous to the chardev; RX is interrupt-driven (RXI when `SCSCR.RIE`).

SCIF0 (MIDI) additionally has its receive path bound to DMAC channel 13
(`MIDI_RX_DMA_CHANNEL`): bytes arriving from the host `-serial`/`--midi` chardev
are pushed straight into the channel's self-linking receive ring (the firmware
reads MIDI by polling the channel's `CRDA`), mirroring the PIC's DMA receive on
channel 12. Each received MIDI byte also triggers the receive-timing capture
path (DMA channel 14, `MIDI_RX_TIMING_DMA_CHANNEL`), which snapshots the SSI
sample counter into its own self-linking ring so the firmware can timestamp
incoming MIDI events.

### DMAC — `rza1l-dmac`

Base `0xE8200000` · size `0x800` · 16 channels (0x40-byte blocks), group commons at `0x300`/`0x700`.

| 0x300/0x700 | DCTRL_G0/1 | shadow | |
| 0x310–0x320 | DSTAT_EN/ER/END/TC/SUS | modelled | computed from per-channel state |

On `CHCTRL.SETEN` it synchronously copies `N0TB` bytes `N0SA → N0DA` honouring
addr modes, then sets `END|TC` and pulses the per-channel DMAINT (if `DEM` clear).
Channel 6 is a self-advancing audio TX ring; channel 12 is the PIC RX ring.

Reads return the current value; writes re-base the counter. No prescaler / compare / interrupt modelling.

### GPIO — `rza1l-gpio`

Pure register shadow with loopback. No pin multiplexing, edge detection, or bidirectional buffers.

### RSPI0 — SPI · `rza1l-rspi`

### SPIBSC — SPI multi-I/O flash controller · `rza1l-spibsc`

Manual-mode transfers complete instantly; no backing flash.

### SSIF0 — serial sound interface (I²S) · `rza1l-ssif`

Base `0xE820B000` · size `0x800` · IRQs SSII0/SSIRXI0/SSITXI0 (GIC SPI 140/141/142 ← INTC 172/173/174), wired but quiescent.

The firmware streams audio through DMA (ch6 TX → SSIFTDR, ch7 RX ← SSIFRDR) and
tracks playback from the DMA source address, so the FIFOs are never CPU-serviced.

With an audio backend bound (`-audiodev …,id=deluge0 -global rza1l-ssif.audiodev=deluge0`,
e.g. via `run.sh --audio`), the device opens a 44.1 kHz stereo S32 output voice
and mirrors the transmit DMA ring from guest memory to the host (silence until
the firmware arms the ring). Without an audiodev the audio path is inactive.

The receive channel is modelled symmetrically: ch7's CRDA advances from virtual
time at the sample rate (so the firmware's input-latency resync tracks a live
write pointer), and an input voice writes captured frames into the RX ring at
CRDA. With no capture source the input is silence.

### USB200 / USB201 — USB 2.0 host/function · `rza1l-usb`

Base `0xE8010000` (USB200, used) and `0xE8207000` (USB201) · size `0x200` ·
IRQs USBI0/USBI1 (GIC SPI 41/42 ← INTC 73/74).

The firmware brings up the Renesas USB stack at start-up in host mode. Two
modes are modelled, selected by the `midi` property (default off):

**Disconnected (default).** No device is attached, mirroring an unplugged
cable:

- SYSSTS0.LNST = 00 (SE0). The firmware's synchronous attach probe in
  `hw_usb_hmodule_init` sees no device and falls back to peripheral mode.
- Configuration registers (SYSCFG0, BUSWAIT, DVSTCTR0, the FIFO/pipe selectors,
  INTENB0/1, …) are shadowed; status registers read back zero, so the USBIn
  line stays deasserted.

**Attached USB-MIDI device** (`-global rza1l-usb.midi=on`). The controller
presents a permanently-attached full-speed USB-MIDI device on the host port and
drives the firmware's host enumeration to completion:

- SYSSTS0.LNST reports FS-J from boot, so the firmware's synchronous attach
  probe detects the device, performs the inline bus reset (USBRST→UACT, HSPROC
  poll), and stays in host mode.
- Writing INTENB1.ATTCH with a device present raises a one-shot ATTCH interrupt,
  which kicks the MGR task into enumeration.
- Control transfers over the DCP (pipe 0) are answered with synthetic
  descriptors: an 18-byte device descriptor, a 101-byte configuration
  descriptor describing an AudioControl + MIDIStreaming interface pair (one
  MIDI IN jack, one MIDI OUT jack, bulk IN/OUT endpoints 0x81/0x01), and the
  LANGID string. The model generates the SACK / BRDY / BEMP interrupts the
  firmware's control-transfer state machine expects, including the multi-packet
  BRDY re-arm for the 101-byte read and the IN/OUT status-stage handshakes.
- The firmware completes GET_DESCRIPTOR → SET_ADDRESS → GET_DESCRIPTOR(full
  config) → SET_CONFIGURATION, recognises the audio-class interface as a
  USB-MIDI device, and sets up its bulk MIDI pipes.

Bulk MIDI data transfer over the configured pipes (bridging the D0/D1 FIFOs to a
host MIDI chardev as 32-bit USB-MIDI event packets) is not yet implemented; see
the follow-up issue. USB mass-storage device emulation is likewise out of scope.

### ADC — S12AD battery sense · `rza1l-adc`

## Board-level devices (no MMIO)

These attach via a chardev, GPIO, or graphic console rather than a physical
window, so they have no register map.

| Device | Type | Attaches via | Role |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ | ---- |
| Input PIC | `chardev-deluge-pic` | SCIF1 chardev + DMA ch10/12 | pad/button/encoder ↔ LED/OLED command protocol |
| OLED | `deluge-oled` | RSPI0 SPI + PIC control lines | SSD130x decoder, 128×48 framebuffer |
| Pad grid | `deluge-padgrid` | PIC colour messages | 18×8 RGB pads |
| 7-segment | `deluge-segment` | PIC command 224 | 4-digit numeric display |
| Host input | `deluge-input` | QEMU keyboard handler | maps host keys to PIC pad/button events |

## Intentionally unmodelled peripherals

These on-chip blocks fall inside the logging catch-all windows and need no
device model because the firmware never clocks them out of module-standby:

| Block | Window | Why unmodelled |
| ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| SCUX (sample-rate converter) | `0xE8208000` | Held in standby (`STBCR8`); the firmware resamples in software and streams I²S directly via SSIF0/DMA |
| RIIC0–3 (I²C) | `0xFCFEE000`–`0xFCFEEFFF` | Held in standby (`STBCR9`); the codec is hardware-strapped and enabled by a GPIO pin, with no I²C configuration |
